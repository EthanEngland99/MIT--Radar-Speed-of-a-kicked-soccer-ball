# Development of an Experimental Radar System for Estimating the Speed of a Kicked Soccer Ball

This repository is a collection of all code and data need to process Radar (.wav) data files recorded on the MIT coffee can radar. The code includes a functions that process the data for displaying on a Spectrogram, converting frequency to speed and using a Cell-Averaging Constant False Alarm Rate detection algorithm to find usefull data and overlay X's on the spectrogram for clarity

Steps to run the code and produce spectrogram:
1. Ensure code is in the same file location as the recordings.
2. Open "Processing_recordings1.m in MATLAB
3. select the number of the recording you would like to run as commented in the code
4. run the code.
